**Extremophile plants**

Extremophiles plants adapt to harsh environments where most plant species cannot survive. We use a combination of omics approaches to study the evolution and the genetic basis of extraordinary stress-resistance in extremophiles. We are also interested in the epigenetic regulation of stress response in these plant species.

**RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)**

RdDM is critical for establishing de novo DNA methylation patterns in plants. Noncoding RNAs generated by RNA Pol IV and Pol V specifies where de novo DNA methylation should happen, but little is known about how the ncRNAs themselves are regulated. We are interested in identifying factors involved in transcriptional regulation of those ncRNAs and understanding the molecular mechanisms supporting their function.
